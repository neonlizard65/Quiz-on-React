## Quiz Application Technical Specification

### Overview

The quiz application is a web-based platform designed to present users with a series of questions, allowing them to select answers and receive feedback on their performance. The application is built using React.js for the frontend, and it does not involve a backend or database.

### Features

1. **Quiz Display:**

    - The application displays one question at a time.
    - Questions include a prompt and a set of multiple-choice options.

2. **User Interaction:**

    - Users can select one option as their answer for each question.
    - The application provides visual feedback for the selected answer.
    - Users can navigate to the next question after selecting an answer.

3. **Scoring:**

    - The application calculates and displays the user's score based on correct answers.
    - Users receive immediate feedback on whether their answer was correct or incorrect.

4. **Completion:**

    - The quiz concludes when all questions have been answered.
    - The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

5. **Quiz Data:**
    - Quiz questions and options are stored in a separate JSON file (`quizData.json`).
    - The application fetches and uses this data to dynamically generate quiz content.

### Components

1. **Quiz Component (`QuizComponent.tsx`):**

    - Manages the state of the quiz (current question, selected answer, score, etc.).
    - Fetches quiz data from `quizData.json`.
    - Renders questions, options, and handles user interactions.

2. **Question Component (`Question.tsx`):**

    - Displays the question prompt.
    - Renders multiple-choice options.

3. **Option Component (`Option.tsx`):**

    - Represents a single option for a question.
    - Handles user selection and provides visual feedback.

4. **Result Component (`Result.tsx`):**
    - Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.
    - Includes a message based on the user's performance.

### Workflow

1. **Initialization:**

    - The quiz component initializes with the first question.
    - Quiz data is fetched from `quizData.json` and loaded into state.

2. **Question Display:**

    - The question component renders the current question.
    - Options are displayed as clickable elements.

3. **User Interaction:**

    - Users select an option for the current question.
    - The selected option is visually highlighted.

4. **Answer Evaluation:**

    - Upon selecting an option, the application evaluates whether it's correct.
    - Feedback is provided to the user.

5. **Score Update:**

    - The user's score is updated based on correct answers.

6. **Navigation:**

    - Users can navigate to the next question after answering.
    - The next question is loaded, and the process repeats.

7. **Quiz Completion:**
    - The quiz concludes when all questions have been answered.
    - The final score and a completion message are displayed.

### Styling

The application should have a clean and user-friendly interface. Use CSS for styling, and consider making the application responsive for different screen sizes.

### Dependencies

-   React.js
-   quizData.json (for quiz questions and answers)

### Development Environment

-   Node.js and npm for package management.

### Testing

-   Implement unit tests for React components using testing libraries (e.g., Jest and React Testing Library).

### Deployment

-   Deploy the application to a hosting platform of choice (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

### Future Enhancements

-   Implement additional features such as a timer, difficulty levels, or category-specific quizzes.
-   Consider incorporating animations for a more engaging user experience.
